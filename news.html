      <h3>Perfect start to the Pennant season</h3>
      <h4>9/3/20</h4>
      <br>
      <p>I played my third match of the Melbourne Pennant season on Sunday
 and managed a solid 2&1 win, helping The Eastern GC team to a thumping 7-0
 victory. The win on Sunday makes it 3 out of 3 wins for the team so far and
 2 out of 3 wins for me personally. I'm loving being part of the team and
 doing my bit to help the lads push for a third consecutive promotion this
 year. It's also great to be playing plenty of competitive golf before I return
 to the UK at the start of April to kick my season off.</p>

      <h3>Close but no cigar at Vic Open Qualifying</h3> 
      <h4>3/2/20</h4>
      <br>
      <p>The ISPS Handa Vic Open held a qualifying event on the Monday before the
 event. I decided to enter as it was a great chance to possibly play in a European
 Tour event, and also get some much needed competition leading up to the season. I shot 69
 (-2), finishing T7th and 2 shots outside of the qualifying mark.</p>

      <h3>Off season in Aus</h3>
      <h4>20/1/20</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Off season has seen me get a solid three months of warm weather training out in Melbourne, Australia, where I have been
 staying with my partner Olivia. I have been hard at work on all aspects of my game with regular Skype coaching from Simon and Duncan.
 I have been making good use of the excellent practice facilities at The Eastern Golf Club in Melbourne's Yarra Valley region, which is
 my base while I am in Melbourne. In the lead up to the 2020 Europro season, I will be playing Vic Open qualifying and representing The
 Eastern Golf Club's penant team for a few matches.</p>

      <h3>Reflecting on 2019 season</h3>
      <h4>5/1/20</h4>
      <br>
      <p>The 2019 PGA Europro season on the whole was a great success for me. Although a final OOM position of 56th
 was not excactly what I had in mind, it represents a huge improvement after the struggles of my first two seasons as a pro.
 My season included two top tens, and eight out of fifteen cuts made. A big thanks goes to my team; Simon (coach), Andy (physio)
 and Greg and Dunc (Underpin); and all of my sponsors and supporters who helped make everything possible.</p>
