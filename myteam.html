        <h3>Simon Race - Coach</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Simon is the Head Professional at my home course Meltham Golf Club. He has done
 a superb job in this roll since he started there in 2013, and he is held in extremely high
 regard by the members.  Simon has been coaching me since April 2019, and the work we’ve done
 since then has seen great improvements in my long game. His passion and commitment to coaching
 is second to none and I look forward to making great strides under his guidance again this year.</p>

        <h3>Andy Young - Physio</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Andy is a Chartered Physiotherapist and runs his own practice in Holmfirth
 (A P Young Physiotherapy). I’ve also worked with Andy since April 2019. He provides me
 with a tailored program which helps me ensure my body is capable of doing the things I’m
 working on in my golf swing, whilst also maintaining a good base level of strength and fitness.
 I also see him regularly for treatment during the season, to ensure I stay injury free as much
 as possible. Andy is a true expert in his field and a crucial part of my team. </p>

        <h3>Underpin - Management</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Underpin is a sports performance agency founded and run by Greg Robertson and Duncan
 McCarthy. I’ve known both Greg and Duncan for several years now and it was a very easy decision to
 sign with Underpin at the start of 2019. Since then, I’ve found it invaluable having the combination
 of Greg’s business expertise and Duncan’s wealth of experience in performance coaching to help guide
 me through the early stages of my professional career. Their player first approach helps me identify
 ways to maximise my potential both on and off the course.</p>
