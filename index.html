          <h3>Who am I?</h3>
          <p>I’m a 26 year old professional golfer from Huddersfield, England. I play out of Meltham
 GC and Woodsome Hall GC, both in West Yorkshire. I currently play on the UK based PGA Europro Tour.</p>
          <h3>How I started</h3>
          <p>I come from a family full of golf fanatics! My dad is a very accomplished player (playing off
 a handicap of 4), and both my grandads have been very keen golfers for a long time. Hence, I was playing with
 plastic clubs as soon as I could walk! I’ve been a member at my home club Meltham since the age of 7.</p>
          <h3>Why golf?</h3>
          <p>I had a go at every sport going when I was a kid, before settling on football and golf. At age 13, I
 quit football so that I could focus more on golf. I loved the feeling of a well struck golf shot, and I got hooked
 on the process of practicing, improving, and seeing the results out on the course.</p>
          <h3>My Ambitions</h3>
          <p>I managed to achieve many of the ambitions I had growing up, during my amateur career. I represented
 England, travelled the world and won national and international tournaments. But I have many goals still to achieve.
 I want to play and win on the European Tour, PGA Tour, win majors, and become the best player I can be.</p>
          <h3>Other Hobbies and Interests</h3>
          <p>I am starting to realize more and more the importance of having other interests outside of golf, to maintain
 a healthy, balanced lifestyle. My hobbies off the course include playing guitar, watching football (Arsenal if you
 were wondering!) and I have also recently started to learn computer coding. I actually coded this website myself!</p>

          <h3>Close but no cigar at Vic Open Qualifying</h3> 
          <h4>3/2/20</h4>
          <br>
          <p>The ISPS Handa Vic Open held a qualifying event on the Monday before the
 event. I decided to enter as it was a great chance to possibly play in a European
 Tour event, and also get some much needed competition leading up to the season. I shot 69
 (-2), finishing T7th and 2 shots outside of the qualifying mark.</p>

          <h3>Off season in Aus</h3>
          <h4>20/1/20</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Off season has seen me get a solid three months of warm weather training out in Melbourne, Australia, where I have been
 staying with my partner Olivia. I have been hard at work on all aspects of my game with regular Skype coaching from Simon and Duncan.
 I have been making good use of the excellent practice facilities at The Eastern Golf Club in Melbourne's Yarra Valley region, which is
 my base while I am in Melbourne. In the lead up to the 2020 Europro season, I will be playing Vic Open qualifying and representing The
 Eastern Golf Club's penant team for a few matches.</p>

          <h3>Reflecting on 2019 season</h3>
          <h4>5/1/20</h4>
          <br>
          <p>The 2019 PGA Europro season on the whole was a great success for me. Although a final OOM position of 56th
 was not excactly what I had in mind, it represents a huge improvement after the struggles of my first two seasons as a pro.
 My season included two top tens, and eight out of fifteen cuts made. A big thanks goes to my team; Simon (coach), Andy (physio)
 and Greg and Dunc (Underpin); and all of my sponsors and supporters who helped make everything possible.</p>
