          <p>I'm a golfer from Meltham. At the moment I don't really know much more about myself than
 that so I'm just going to keep typing random nonsense until the about me box is pretty much filled.
 This will allow me to get a clear picture of what my website will look like once I have inserted all
 the actual content. Without any content its hard to gauge the actually appearance of different webpage
 sections and elements. <br><br>So I just refreshed the browser after typing the first paragraph and realised
 that I had only filled a small section of this box. I thought I'd typed a lot of text but apparently not.
 Oh well I'll just have to keep typing. I could make the font bigger to fill more of the box, like everyone used
 to do at school when their homework had to be a certain number of pages, but I am happy with the look of
 this font size, so I'm not going to do that. <br><br>I actually just realised that I need to add padding to this
 section as the text goes right up to the edge of the blue bit at the moment, which is not good. I'll go back into
 my code and add some padding, hopefully then there might be enough placeholder text to fill the box.</p>

          <h3>Close but no cigar at Vic Open Qualifying - 3/2/20</h3> 
          <br>
          <p>The ISPS Handa Vic Open held a qualifying event on the monday before
 event. I decided to enter with it being a great chance to possibly play in a european
 tour event, and also get some much needed competition leading up to the season. I shot 69
 (-2), finishing T7th and 2 shots outside of the qualifying mark.</p>
