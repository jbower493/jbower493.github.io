          <h3>Who am I?</h3>
          <p>I’m a 26 year old professional golfer from Huddersfield, England,  playing out of Meltham
 GC and Woodsome Hall GC (West Yorkshire). I currently play on the UK based PGA Europro Tour.</p>
          <h3>How I started</h3>
          <p>I come from a family full of golf fanatics! My dad is a very accomplished player (playing off
 a handicap of 4), and both my grandads have been very keen golfers for a long time. Hence I was introduced
 to the game pretty much as soon as I could walk! I’ve been a member at my home club Meltham since the age of 7.</p>
          <h3>Why golf?</h3>
          <p>I had a go at every sport going when I was a kid, before settling on football and golf. At age 13 I
 quit football to allow me to focus more on golf. I loved the feeling of a well struck golf shot, and I got hooked
 on the process of practicing, improving, and seeing the results out on the course.</p>
          <h3>My Ambitions</h3>
          <p>I managed to achieve many of the ambitions I had growing up, during my amateur career, like representing
 England, travelling the world and winning National and International tournaments. But there are many still ahead of
 me. I want to play and win on the European Tour, PGA Tour, win majors, and become the best player I can be.</p>
          <h3>Other Hobbies and Interests</h3>
          <p>I’m starting to realize more and more the importance having other interests outside of golf, to maintain
 a healthy, balanced lifestyle. My hobbies off the course include playing guitar, watching football (Arsenal if you
 were wondering!) and I’ve also recently started to learn coding. I actually coded this website myself!</p>

          <h3>Close but no cigar at Vic Open Qualifying - 3/2/20</h3> 
          <br>
          <p>The ISPS Handa Vic Open held a qualifying event on the monday before
 event. I decided to enter with it being a great chance to possibly play in a european
 tour event, and also get some much needed competition leading up to the season. I shot 69
 (-2), finishing T7th and 2 shots outside of the qualifying mark.</p>
